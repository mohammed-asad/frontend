          <h3>1. BROCHURE ACCURACY</h3>
          <p>Brochures are printed several months in advance and the brochures’ description of services are printed as accurate as possible during the time of its publication. However, we do not have direct control over the suppliers as we are Tour Operators and do not own any hotels, airlines, restaurants, cruises or coaches. Circumstances beyond our control like major road works, traffic congestions, weather conditions, fairs, festivals, sport events, political/religious gatherings, strikes, change of management/closure of hotels/restaurants, over booking of hotels/flights, cancellation/ re-routing of flights or railway, closure of / restricted entry at a place of sight seeing and any other circumstances not mentioned herewith may result in changes in the services / itineraries. Therefore, we reserve the absolute right to alter, amend, change or modify the Tour Package, Itineraries, tour Schedule, travel plan, tour arrangements and sightseeing. Where we may know of these sufficiently in advance we will notify the client, otherwise our Tour Managers or local representative/s will inform you of the changes on the spot. There are also very big Fairs and Exhibitions lasting up to 2 weeks, where all the hotels are fully booked several years ahead. Every effort is made to avoid such dates, but in the few instances where it is unavoidable, it may be necessary to stay in hotels in other cities. (This would be advised as advance as possible).</p>
          <h3>2. THE BOOKING</h3>
          <p>Your contract is with Holidaymate Hospitality LLP. A contract exists between us when we have confirmed that we have space available on the tour of your choice and we have received your signed Travel Confirmation Form and advance.</p>
          <h3>3. DEPOSIT</h3>
          <p>Upon completion of the signed booking form 30% of the tour cost, must be paid to the company.</p>
          <h3>4. PAYMENT</h3>
          <p>Payments should be made in the name of Holidaymate Hospitality LLP by cheque or DD preferably. Payment by DD can be drawn at our cost. In unavoidable circumstances, cash payments are accepted. We also accept credit cards. There will be a surcharge of 2% on card payments which will be added to the total invoice cost. For bookings which are made within 10 working days of tour departure, the full amount will become immediately payable either by DD, CASH OR CREDIT CARD ONLY.</p>
          <h3>5. BALANCE</h3>
          <p>Once the completed Travel Confirmation Form and the advance have been received an invoice will be sent, along with a receipt for the money already paid. The full payment towards the cost of the tour must be paid at least 20 days prior to tour departure. Failure to pay the balance within the specified period will result in the cancellation of the booking, and the payment of a cancellation fee, as detailed below.</p>
